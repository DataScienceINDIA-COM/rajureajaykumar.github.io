## Installation

If you want to run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:


## Deployment

This website is a static site and is best deployed using GitHub Pages, especially given the repository name `rajureajaykumar.github.io`.

**Steps to Deploy/Update on GitHub Pages:**

1.  **Push Changes:** Ensure all your latest code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) is committed and pushed to the `main` branch of this repository.
2.  **Configure GitHub Pages Settings (One-time setup):**
    *   In your GitHub repository, go to `Settings` > `Pages`.
    *   Under `Build and deployment`, for the `Source`, select `Deploy from a branch`.
    *   Under `Branch`, select `main` (or your default branch) and the `/ (root)` folder.
    *   Click `Save`.
3.  **Access Your Site:** After a minute or two for GitHub Actions to build and deploy, your site will be live at `https://rajureajaykumar.github.io`.

Any subsequent pushes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a redeployment to GitHub Pages if configured as above.
