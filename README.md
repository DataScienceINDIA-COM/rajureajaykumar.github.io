## API Usage

API endpoints will be detailed here once they are available.

## CI/CD

This project utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Trigger:** The CI/CD pipeline is triggered on every push to the main branch.
2.  **Build:** The application dependencies are installed.
3.  **Test:** Unit tests (e.g., using `test_code_sense.py`) are executed to ensure code quality.
4.  **Deploy:** If tests pass, the application (`app.py`) is automatically deployed to the configured cloud environment (Google Cloud Run, AWS Lambda, or Heroku).

**Setup:**

To set up the CI/CD pipeline, you will need to configure GitHub Actions in your repository and provide the necessary credentials for your cloud deployment environment.
