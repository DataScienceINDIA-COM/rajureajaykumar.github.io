<h2>Predictive Models for Retention</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> To develop and deploy predictive models that accurately forecast customer retention, leading to targeted interventions and a measurable increase in retention rates (20% achieved).</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Dataiku DSS, Python</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Dataiku DSS, Python Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), Database Connectors, Deployment APIs</p>
<p>Developed and deployed predictive models, resulting in a 20% increase in customer retention rates for Novartis.</p>
